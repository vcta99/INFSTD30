This week’s readings focused on the accessibility of information online. 

The need for storing large quantities of data was a product of World War , as explained in “As We May Think.” Scientific research was incredibly active during this time period, and the general public demanded that these findings be accessible to all. Not only that, but scientists themselves needed faster, more accurate methods to share and store their data. This lead to the higher quality cameras and film processes, more complex calculators, and the invention of “associative indexing”, where any item can be selected immediately and automatically select another.

In “Information Management: A Proposal,” Berners-Lee, the “web” as we know it was created in order to develop a system of information organization. This “web” would link nodes and keywords to each other. In the display, this web would be presented through hypertext, hypermedia, and hotspots. These definitions and importance of these terms are explored through “What Hypertext Is”. As defined by Ted Nelson, hypertext can access a branch/perform on the request of the user. Hypermedia is the branching or performance of a request, but in nontext form (pictures, videos, etc.). A hotspot is an icon that appears when one hovers over hypertext/hypermedia, usually giving a description of what is being presented. Hypertext has become the foundation of web display: accessible from different systems and able to update live.

“The Design of Browsing and Berrypicking Techniques for the Online Search Interface” goes into depth on online search. The article emphasizes, “the more different strategies searchers can use an information store, the more retrieval effectiveness and efficiency is possible.” Thus, allowing for a diversity of search methods make the search process feel more natural to the user.

These readings have shown us how the internet has become a wealth of knowledge. This development has many possible ramifications on the future of education, as the internet is making resources more affordable and accessible. In “Computer Lib/Dream Machines”, the authors postulates on how computer assisted instruction (CAI) can be improved. 

CAI models closely follow existing educational apps today. Duolingo, for example, organizes the learning process into different subjects, testing the student in mandatory quizes, and heavily relies on repetition and positive reinforcement (in the form of dialogue or points). A critique of this model is that the student is purely result-driven, diminishing their initial curiosity or passion for learning. These flaws all stem from a lack of control on the students part. The learning process should be designed in such a way where the student is in control of what they learn, what they are tested on, and to what extent. This optimizes learning on their own terms. 

A key line in this piece that I strongly identify with is, ““Repetition and reinforcement are not important if the student hates what they are doing.” Technology cannot improve lives if it is modeled on the flawed systems of reality. The internet offers a unique capacity to overcome structural flaws in our educational system.

# Week 1 Blog Post
Conversations around technology and media today emphasize the unprecedented growth of it all. It is completely true, the world is more connected than ever before, breaking news stories and viral videos can leave us completely captivated one day and apathetic the next. There is a general feeling of novelty and fear and excitement. While the technology that inspires those feelings is new, the feelings themselves are not.

Tuesday’s readings broke down “the cycle” of new technologies. First, they were innovated as a direct result of existing technologies, to challenge existing structures. Wu explains, “that which is centralized becomes a target for assault.” These innovations were designed to be as “open” and accessible as possible. Society conditioned these advancements to be seen as a public good. Although owned by a private entity, the monopolistic market structure would allow for the most effective and efficient distribution of the new service. In centralizing this entity, some users were inevitably marginalized. 

The world wide web, with all of its grandiosity and potential is no different. The Master Switch: The Rise and Fall of Information Empires argues that this cycle will repeat itself and that the internet will become centralized. The author uses the AT&T as model for this cycle, paying particular focus on then-owner Theodore Vail, and his great hopes of unity and connectivity. We see this today as well. Today, the role of a tech CEO philanthropist with an eccentric vision of the future is Elon Musk. In framing technology through the lens of a cycle, Wu also insinuates that the centralization of the internet may not result in the end of the world. It is a cycle, it will repeat, and new inventions will come to take the internet’s place.

This cycle arguable starts with the telegraph. In Technology and Ideology: The Case of the Telegraph, Carey describes how the invention of the telegraph fundamentally changed the way society envisioned communication, transformation, business, time, and space. All technologies created afterwards only intensified these effects.

The field of journalism, for example, was forcibly standardized through the use of the telegraph. Articles were written as succinctly and factually as possible in order to reach a broad audience in order to maximize revenue. Any trace of “local flavor” was lost. This style of journalism remains with us today. The telegraph shaped language in a way very similar to tweets/memes do today, the latter of which relying heavily on visuals with as little words as possible as to be understood as quickly as possible. This helps the post go viral, and gain monetization.
